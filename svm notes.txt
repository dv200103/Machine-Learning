SVM (Support vector Machine)
-> supervised ML algo which can be used to solve classification as well as regression problems.

Objective -:
-SVM is based on the idea of finding a hyperplane/ Decision line in an N-Dimensional space that best seperate the features into different domains.

Hyperplane-:

-Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that classify the data points into classes. Data points falling either side of the hyperplane can be classified to different classes.
-Dimension of hyperplane is depends on number of features. i.e if no of features are 2, then hyperplane is line. if no of features are 3 or more than 3 then it is known as 2d hyperplane

-----------------------
support vectors-:
Support vectores are data points that are closer to the hyperplance and influence the position of the hyperplane.

support vectors plays imp role to draw decision line/hyperplane.
-------------------------------------

Margin-: The distance of vectoors from the hyperplane are called margins.
-distance from boundary line to decision line.

Best hyperplane ----> hyperplane with High margin is considered as best hyperplane.
-------------------------------------------------
kernel -: Kernel is used to handle non-linear dataset as we can not draw best decision line in non linear data.
kernel will add extra dimension to handle non-linear data by finding out best hyperplane in higher dimension space.


---------------

Advantages of SVM-:
1) it can handle linear as well non linear data. -: it handle linear data by finding a best decison line and it handles non linear data by using kernel trick.

2) it can be used to solve classification as well as regression problems.

3) stability -: A small change to the data does not affect the hyperplane.


Disadvantages
1) choosing a correct kernel type.
2) extensive memroy requirement - > High complex algo , high vol. of computation requires.
3) Long trining time on large non linear data
4) it requires Feature scaling
5) difficult to intrpret results of SVM
