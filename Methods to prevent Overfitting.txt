Methods to prevent Overfitting:

1. Ridge and Lasso Regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting in regression models.

2. Cross Validation method is also used for regression models.

3. Ensemble methods are ideal for regression and classification,
where they reduce bias and variance to boost the accuracy of models.
Bagging: used to Reduce Variance.
Boosting: used to Reduce Bias
