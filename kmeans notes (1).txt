Clustering?

-CLustering is a unsupervised learning process of creating groups of data points  based on similarity.
-HEre we dont have target column. we look at the data and then try to club similar observation and form different groups.

Application of clustering/ where to apply clustering>?

-customer segmentation.
-recommendation system.

How to perform clustering?
- We have two algorithms to perform clustering
1) K-Means clustering
2) Hierarchical clustering.

-------------------------------------
How K-Means works?
Here K is -: no of groups/clusters to make.

1) Decide the value of K.
(To decide the value of K we must have Domain knowledge).

2) Select K centroids
(Centroids can be selected randomly or can be selected from datapoints.)

3) By calculating the Euclidean distance assign the datapoint to the nearest centroids/cluster.Now again find the new centroid for that cluster and keep doing this process for inner iteration times (default value is 300).
and then calculate inertia.

4) Now again re-generate centroids and go to step no 3. Keep doing this process for Outer iteration times. (default value:- 10)

5) Final centroids/clusters are selected whose inertia value is low.


How Good clusters/final clusters are selected?
(refer whitboard)

How to select number of cluster to make?
1)You must domain knowledge
2)Use Elbow technique/ Method ( refer whiteboard.)
