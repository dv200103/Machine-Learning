Linear Regression alog-:

-Supervised ML algo used to predict cont. target varaible.
-it uses label data for prediction.
-It tries to establish relationship between X (indepedent variable) and Y (target) by finding out
best fit line.
-Line can be drawn with y=mx+c
here, y --> target
m--> slope --> how much y is changing wrt x (it indicate steepness of a line)
x--> indepedent var.
c--> intercept. ( a location where it intersects an axis)

what is best fit line ?

-when a line is covering maximum data points from dataset or most of the points are close to a line,
is known as best fit line. 
- in best fit line error rate is very low and accuracy is high.

what is error?
-> gap/ distance between actual data point and predicted data point.
-> this is also known as residual.
-> error rate must be low as possible.

how to find best fit line??

Gradient descent helps us to draw best fit line by calculating best values of m and c by taking 
partial derivative at each step.


step1 -: machine will randomly select m and c value
step2 -: based on this m and c it will draw a line using y=mx+c
step3-: now it will calculate error rate. and tries to minimize it.
step4-: it will calculate new values of m and c by taking partial derivative of old m &c 
step5-: using this new values it draw a line.
step6 -:cont this process till error rate becomes low.
