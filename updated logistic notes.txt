Logistic regression-:

-> It is a supervised ML algo used to solve classificatio problems.
-> It predicts outcomes which are categorical in nature.
-> Logistic regression uses sigmoid/ logistic function to classify a data point.
-> Logistic/sigmoid function always return probablistic value that lies between 0 to 1
-> In logistic regression , instead of fitting best fit line , we fit "s" shaped curve, which predicts 
two maximum values (0 or 1)
->Curve indicates likelihood of something.
->Sigmiod function maps any value into a range of 0-1
->logistic function uses threshold which help to classify a data point.
->value above threshold will be considered as 1 , value less than threshold will be considered as 0
-> It is widely used to solve binary classfication problems.

-------------------------------------
Assumption of Logistic Regression.
1)Target must be categorical in nature.
2)NO multi-collinearity
-------------------------------------------
Advantages
-Performs well on linear data.
-Results are easily interepretable.
-It works well on large data sets
-faster training because of sigmoid function.
- works well on binary datasets

Disadvantages
- it does not perform well on non-linear data.
- It does work well on high dimensional data ( Large features)-
- It makes assumptions on data.
- It does not work well on multiclassification datasets

HyperTuning Parameters
1) penalty -: it adds penalty term. possible values are - {l1,l2,elasticnet,none}
2) solver -: liblinear,sag,saga,lbfgs
3) multi_class -: auto,ovr,mltinomial
------------------------------------------

ROC -AUC curve ( Receiver operating characteristics Area Under Curve)

-> it is a performance metrics for the classification problem at various threshold settings.
->It tell how much the model is capable of classifying between classes.
->Higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting 0 class as 0 and 1 class as 1.
-> high value of AUC means model is good and vice versa
-> It is graph which we plot with TPR vs FPR. where TPR is on Y axis and FPR is on X axis.
